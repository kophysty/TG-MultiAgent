- After creating or updating each new layout render prompt, include the version in the prompt name, create a new prompt, and log comments or issues about the current prompt in prompt_issues_log.md.

- Before rebuilding the container with cache cleaning, first check if the required code is already inside the container. In 99% of cases, the code is already there.

- When saving memory, using mcp memory, follow the instructions from these commands file: .cursor/commands/save-context.md

- All plans saved in .cursor/plans must have an ordinal number and date before their names.
- Try to not use up keys letters in the file names 
- If you are saving a file inside a folder where similar files already exist, try to continue the existing file naming style. if there are ordinal numbers and dates present, follow this practice and number your file accordingly, including the ordinal number and date.
- After each AI render session, agree with the user on a single "golden" winner render for that session and append it to the ratings table in `docs/Render/GoldenRenders/index.md` with model scores and short human commentary.
